<h1>Greenwell Bank Style Guide</h1>
<h2>Published April 25, 2015</h2>
<h2>Version 1.0</h2>
<em>Produced by the Greenwell Marketing Communications Department in Conjunctio with Information Technology</em>
    </div>
    
    
<p>The following are a set of guidelines for application developers to use when developing web and mobile applications for Greenwell. Developers who have questions or wish to break from the guidelines should contact Bruce Elgort on the CTEC 227 Slack channel.</p>

<p>Greenwell takes a minimalistic approach to app design. We try not to overwhelm our users with too much information on a page. We also use “design thinking” when laying out our pages and strive to create the best user experience possible. We also subscribe to the IBM Design Language which you can find here http://www.ibm.com/design/</p>

<h2>Colors</h2>

<p>The following are a list of approved colors to be used on Greenwell Bank websites and mobile applications.</p>

<h4>#004800  Used for headings</h4>
<div class="panel">#90C32E  Used for panel backgrounds</div>
#333333  Used for text
<div class="accent">#387929  Available for use as applicable</div>

<p>Other colors may be used with persmission by Bruce Elgort, IT/Marcom Director.</p>

<h2>Text</h2>

<p>The bank has standardized on using Futura. You can learn more about Futura on this site http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/futura/</p>

<p>Text should never be justified. Developers should use a line height that makes any multi-line text readable and clear.</p>

<h2>Logos</h2>

<p>The Greenwell Logo should be displayed on all pages. The logo should be small and non obtrusive on the page. Only the logo is needed and not “Greenwell Bank”. Greenwell Bank should always be contained as part of a pages title. The title for web applications should use the <strong>&lt;title&gt;</strong> HTML element.</p>

<p>The logo can be found in the CTEC 227 Slack #greenwelldesignassets channel. An AI, EPS and JPG file are available. No color changes should be made to the logo nor should it be altered in any way.</p>

<h2>Navigation</h2>

<p>Developers should never use cascading menus for navigation. All menus are to be located near the top of pages. Textual navigation should always be included in the footer of all pages.</p>

<h2>Error Messages, Prompts and Forms</h2>

<p>Users should never be left guessing what caused an error. Every attempt should be made by the developer to ensure that the user sees meaningful notifications and errors. They should never be presented with messages to call the IT Help Desk or Support Center. Developers should trap errors and proactively react to them if and as they occur.</p>

<p>All Prompts should be clear and concise. HTML labels should be used for screen accessibility. All forms should use labels. All call-to-actions on forms should be made clear. Do not use terms like “submit” on form buttons. Make them meaningful for the action being performed.</p>
